# ROOT files

`xrdroot` opens a ROOT file and reads its trees in Python — over `root://`,
`https://`, WebDAV, `s3://` or a local path, with no ROOT and no C++ anywhere
in the way. What it reads comes back as NumPy arrays, and
[goes on](#into-pandas-awkward-arrow-and-polars) to pandas, Awkward, Arrow,
Polars and `hist` in one call. It [writes new files](#writing) too, and
histograms and graphs [draw themselves](#drawing), onto matplotlib axes or into
plain characters.

```python
import xrdroot

with xrdroot.open_root("root://eos.example.org//store/events.root") as f:
    tree = f["Events"]
    print(len(tree), tree.keys())
    pt = tree["Muon_pt"].array(0, 10_000)
```

Nothing is downloaded. A tree is a set of *baskets* — compressed blocks of
consecutive entries, one branch at a time — and asking for entries 0 to 10 000
of one branch reads the baskets that hold them and nothing else. That is what
makes it reasonable to walk a hundred-gigabyte file from a laptop: the bytes
that cross the wire are the ones asked for.

## Opening

```python
xrdroot.open_root("/local/path/f.root")  # a path
xrdroot.open_root("davs://dav.example.org/store/f.root")  # any scheme this library speaks
xrdroot.open_root(open("f.root", "rb"))  # an open file, left open
```

A file is a mapping from name to object:

```python
f.keys()  # ['Events', 'metadata']
f.classnames()  # {'Events': 'TTree', 'metadata': 'TH1F'}
f.trees()  # ['Events']
f.tree()  # the only tree, or a KeyError naming the ones there are
f["dir/sub/Events"]  # directories nest, with a path
f["Events;1"]  # an older cycle, when a file kept several
```

`classnames()` is the first thing to try when something will not open: it says
what a name is without reading any of it.

A name that is not a tree is read too, when the file describes the class it
holds — which is the usual case for a C++ class somebody wrote, and for most of
ROOT's own kit as well:

```python
f["tlv"]  # {'TObject': {...}, 'fP': {'fX': 10.0, ...}, 'fE': 40.0}
f["FileSummaryRecord"]  # a std::string key is a str
f["written"]  # a TDatime is a datetime.datetime
f["h1d"]  # a histogram is a Histogram, and a graph a Graph
```

Objects held by pointer are followed, whether the class promises they are there
or writes the name of the class in front of them; a `TList`, `TObjArray`,
`TClonesArray` or `TArray` member is read the way it streams itself rather than
by the members it declares — a `TClonesArray` names the one class it holds at
the front, and a slot never filled comes back as `None` rather than shifting
the rest along; and a container of objects is read one object after another, or
a field at a time when it was written that way — every object's first member,
then every object's second — which is how ROOT writes a container of plain C++
objects and a `TClonesArray` asked to bypass its streamer. A `vector` of pairs
comes back as the list of tuples it is. A class
inside an entry that this reader cannot walk — one the file does not describe,
or one that streams itself some way of its own — comes back as the name of its
class, because the length written in front of it says how to step over it
without touching anything else.

The bytes have to account for themselves: a class that streams itself in some
way of its own leaves the object a different length than the layout says, and
that is refused by name rather than read into a plausible wrong answer.

## Histograms

A `TH1`, `TH2` or `TH3` of any bin type comes back as a `Histogram`: bins,
edges and what is in them, counted the way Python counts.

```python
h = f["h1d"]
h.name, h.title, h.shape  # ('h1d', 'h1d', (10,))
h.values()  # array([  6.6,  72.6, 543.4, ...])
h.errors()  # the same shape, from the sums of squared weights
h.variances(), h.counts()  # squared errors, and the effective number of fills
h.edges()  # 11 edges for 10 bins
h.axes[0].centers()  # where a point would be drawn
h.sum(), h.entries  # 11000.0, 10004.0
len(h), len(h.axes[0])  # 10, 10
```

`values()[0]` is the first bin of the axis, not the underflow. ROOT keeps two
extra bins per axis for what fell off each end, and `values(flow=True)` gives
them back at the ends where ROOT keeps them — so `sum(flow=True)` is everything
that was ever filled and `sum()` is what landed on the axis.

Everything is a NumPy array shaped the way the axes are, x first:
`values()[ix, iy]` is the bin ROOT calls `GetBinContent(ix+1, iy+1)`, and a
three-dimensional one takes a third index.

A histogram filled with weights keeps the sum of their squares, and that is
where `errors()` comes from; one filled without them keeps no such sum, and
then the error on a count of *n* is its square root, which is what ROOT itself
would give. An unevenly binned axis keeps every edge and those are given back
exactly; an evenly binned one keeps none, and they are worked out from the ends.

Every member the histogram was written with is still there under `h.members`,
under the name of the class that declared it, so nothing is hidden by being
tidied away.

A `Histogram` speaks the plotting protocol that `hist`, `boost-histogram` and
`mplhep` share — `kind`, `values()`, `variances()`, `counts()` and `axes`, each
axis a sequence of `(low, high)` bins — so any of those takes one as it stands,
and two methods hand it over outright:

```python
import mplhep

mplhep.histplot(f["h1d"])  # drawn straight from the file
f["h1d"].to_hist()  # a hist.Hist, with Weight storage when it was weighted
values, edges = f["h1d"].to_numpy()  # as numpy.histogram would give them
f["h1d"].density()  # divided by bin width and total, integrating to one
```

## Graphs

A `TGraph`, `TGraphErrors`, `TGraphAsymmErrors` or `TGraphMultiErrors` comes
back as a `Graph`, which is a sequence of points:

```python
g = f["tge"]
len(g), g[0]  # 4, (1.0, 2.0)
for x, y in g:
    ...
g.x, g.y  # NumPy arrays, one value per point
g.points()  # [(1.0, 2.0), (2.0, 4.0), ...]
below, above = g.yerr  # the bars either side, or None if none were kept
```

`xerr` and `yerr` are always a pair, low side first, so the same code reads a
graph whose bars are symmetric and one whose are not — a graph that kept one
array for both sides gives that array twice. A `TGraph` proper kept none, and
both are `None`.

A `TGraphMultiErrors` keeps its y errors in layers — statistical and
systematic, say — and `g.layers` is those pairs of bars in the order they were
added. Asking such a graph for `yerr` raises rather than picking a layer or
summing them for you, because how to combine them is physics, not format. For
every other graph `layers` is simply `(yerr,)`, or `()` when none were kept.

A graph or histogram met *inside* another object — in the list a `TMultiGraph`
keeps, behind a pointer in a `TEfficiency` — comes back as a `Graph` or
`Histogram` too, the same as it would standing in a key of its own.

## Drawing

ROOT draws through a `TCanvas`, which this library does not carry. What it
has instead is the two ways Python usually looks at data. `plot()` draws onto
matplotlib axes — made on demand, or brought along — and returns them, so
styling and saving carry on where it left off:

```python
ax = f["h1d"].plot()  # steps for 1D, a shaded mesh for 2D
f["tge"].plot(ax=ax, color="crimson")  # points with their error bars
ax.figure.savefig("both.png")
```

matplotlib is not a dependency; `pip install xrdroot[plot]` brings it,
and without it `plot()` refuses with both ways out by name. The other way is
`text()`, which needs nothing installed at all and goes anywhere a string
goes — a terminal, a log file, a CI transcript:

```python
print(f["h1d"].text())  # one line per bin: its edges, a bar and the value
print(f["h2d"].text())  # a shaded grid, y upward
print(f["tge"].text())  # a grid of stars with the axis ends labelled
```

A graph of layered error bars draws every layer over the same points; a
three-dimensional histogram has no honest flat picture and refuses both ways,
saying to slice `values()` down to the two dimensions you want to see.

## Columns

```python
tree.show()  # one line per column: name, type, variable or not
tree.typenames()  # {'Muon_pt': 'float32', 'nMuon': 'int32', ...}
tree.keys()  # every column
tree.readable()  # the ones this reader decodes
tree.unreadable  # {name: why not}, rather than quietly missing
```

A column comes back as one of three things, and which one is knowable in
advance from `tree[name].is_jagged` and `typename`:

| The column | What `array()` gives |
| --- | --- |
| a plain number (`x/F`) | a NumPy array of one value per entry |
| a fixed array (`x[10]/F`) | a NumPy array of shape `(entries, branch.length)` |
| a variable one (`x[n]/F`) | a `Jagged` — rows of different lengths |
| a character leaf (`x/C`) | a `list[str]` |
| a string, `std::string` or `TString` | a `list[str]` |
| an STL container | a `list`, one Python object per entry |

```python
tree["nMuon"].array()  # array([2, 0, 3, ...], dtype=int32)
tree["Muon_pt"].array(0, 1000)  # <Jagged 1000 rows of 2431 float32 values>
jets = tree["Muon_pt"].array()
jets[7]  # array([22.5, 19. ], dtype=float32)
jets.lengths()  # array([2, 0, 3, ...])
jets.content, jets.offsets  # every value, and where each row starts and stops
jets[100:200]  # a Jagged of those rows, sharing the same values
values, width = jets.padded()  # a flat rectangle and its width
```

A `Jagged` is kept the way Awkward Array and Arrow keep a list — one flat
array of values and one of offsets — so `jets.to_awkward()` and
`jets.to_arrow()` hand it over without copying the values. Every column is
decoded in C: a basket's bytes become an array in one pass, and the rows of a
variable column are cut out of it by one mask rather than one slice each.

Entry numbers behave like a Python slice, negatives included:
`branch.array(-1000)` is the last thousand entries.

## Reading a file that does not fit

`iterate` walks the tree in batches, holding one batch rather than one file:

```python
for batch in tree.iterate(["Muon_pt", "Muon_eta"], step=50_000):
    analyse(batch["Muon_pt"], batch["Muon_eta"])
```

`tree.arrays()` is the same for one range, and takes every readable column
when it is not told which.

## Into pandas, Awkward, Arrow and Polars

`arrays` and `iterate` take a `library`, which says what to hand the columns
back as:

```python
tree.arrays(["pt", "eta", "jet_pt"], library="pd")  # a pandas DataFrame
tree.arrays(library="ak")  # an Awkward record array
tree.arrays(library="pa")  # a pyarrow Table, jagged columns as large_list
tree.arrays(library="pl")  # a Polars DataFrame
for frame in tree.iterate(step=100_000, library="pd"):
    ...
```

`np`, the default, is a dict of what the branches gave. A jagged column is a
real list type in Awkward, Arrow and Polars, and a column of arrays — one per
row — in pandas; a fixed-size array column is Arrow's `fixed_size_list`. None
of these libraries is a dependency: each is imported when it is asked for, and
one that is not installed is refused with the `pip install` that fixes it.

## C++ classes and containers

A file written by a physics framework is usually a C++ class per entry, split
by ROOT into one branch per member. Those branches are columns here like any
other, under the names ROOT gave them:

```python
tree.keys()  # ['Muon.pt', 'Muon.eta', 'evt.N', 'evt.StlVecF64', ...]
tree["evt.StlVecF64"].array(0, 100)  # <Jagged 100 rows of ...>
```

The object itself is a branch too, holding nothing at all — every byte of it
is in the members — so asking for it gives back one dictionary per entry, and
an object nested inside it is a dictionary inside that:

```python
tree.groups()  # ['evt', 'P3'] - the objects that were split
tree["evt"].array(1, 2)
# [{'I32': 1, 'Str': 'evt-001', 'P3': {'Px': 0, 'Py': 1.0, 'Pz': 0}, ...}]
```

This reads exactly the same baskets as asking for the members, and costs the
same; it is a shape, not a shortcut. `tree.arrays()` and `tree.iterate()`
leave the split objects out, because their members are already there under
their own names and taking both would read every basket twice. A member this
reader will not decode is absent from the dictionary and named in
`tree["evt"].unreadable`, with the same sentence `tree.unreadable` gives it.

A file written with splitting turned off puts the whole object in one branch,
with nothing under it. That reads as the same dictionary per entry, walked
member by member in the order the class declares them, using the layout the
file's own streamer information gives:

```python
tree.keys()  # ['evt'] - the object, and nothing under it
tree["evt"].array(1, 2)
# [{'Beg': 'beg-001', 'I32': 1, 'P3': {'Px': 0, 'Py': 1.0, 'Pz': 0}, ...}]
```

A class that inherits keeps each base under the base's own name, because a
derived class is allowed to declare a member its base already declared and
flattening the two together would quietly drop one of them. `TObject`, which
nearly every ROOT class inherits, comes back as the identifier and bits it
really is:

```python
tree["p4"].array(0, 1)
# [{'TObject': {'fUniqueID': 0, 'fBits': 50331648},
#   'fP': {'TObject': {...}, 'fX': 0.0, 'fY': 1.0, 'fZ': 2.0}, 'fE': 3.0}]
```

Some classes stream themselves rather than being written out by the file's
streamer information - `TLorentzVector` is one - and then the entry is the
class's own record with a version in front of the members. Both are read, and
so is the older `TBranchObject`, which writes the name of the class in front
of every entry; a branch of that kind holding more than one class stops with a
message naming both rather than reading the one as the other.

The same events written the two ways read back the same values, member for
member. Splitting is still the cheaper way to have written them - a split file
lets you read one member without touching the rest, and an unsplit one cannot -
but neither is a file this reader has to refuse. A class the file's streamer
information does not describe is refused, because its layout is then not
knowable, and so is a member of a kind this reader has no reader for: an
unsplit object is read from first byte to last, so one member it cannot walk
past is the whole entry.

A member that is an STL container comes back as the Python thing it most
nearly is, one per entry:

| In the file | In Python |
| --- | --- |
| `std::vector<double>`, `list`, `deque`, `set` of numbers | a `Jagged` — rows of NumPy arrays |
| a container of strings | a `list[list[str]]` |
| `vector<vector<T>>` | a `list` of `list`s of NumPy arrays |
| `std::map<K, V>`, `unordered_map` | a `list[dict]`, one dict per entry |
| `std::string`, `TString` | a `list[str]` |
| `std::vector<bool>` | rows of 0 and 1, a byte an element, which is how ROOT wrote it |
| `ROOT::VecOps::RVec<T>` | whatever the same `std::vector<T>` gives, which is what it is written as |
| `std::bitset<N>` | rows of 0 and 1, `bs[0]` first, a byte a bit as ROOT wrote it |
| `TDatime` | a `datetime.datetime`, out of the one word it packs itself into |

`Double32_t` and `Float16_t` are floats squeezed into three or four bytes by a
recipe written as `[xmin,xmax,nbits]`, where the ends may be given in units of
`pi`. A branch of its own keeps the recipe in the leaf title; a member of a
split class keeps it in the trailing comment on the declaration, which is in
the file's streamer information — either way it is unpacked back to `float64`,
so `typenames()` says `float64` and nothing about the packing reaches you. A
packed member of a class the file does not describe is refused rather than
read at the default, because the wrong recipe gives plausible wrong numbers.

## Into PyTorch and TensorFlow

Turning what comes out of a tree into tensors is [`xrdml`](https://github.com/rob-c/xrdml),
a package of its own on top of this one: `xrdml.tensors` batches a tree into
PyTorch or TensorFlow a basket at a time, and `xrdml.load` takes a URL
straight to a training loop.

## Writing

`create` makes a new ROOT file anywhere this library can put bytes — a local
path, any URL scheme it writes, or an already-open binary file, used as it is
and left open:

```python
import xrdroot

with xrdroot.create("root://eos.example.org//store/user/me/out.root") as f:
    f["counts"] = xrdroot.Histogram.new("counts", edges, values)
    f["scan"] = xrdroot.Graph.new("scan", xs, ys, yerr=bars)
    f["note"] = "made from run 4711"
    f["weights"] = np.asarray(weights)
    f["events"] = {"pt": pt, "eta": eta}  # a tree, from arrays or any DataFrame
    f["spectrum"] = hist_object  # a hist.Hist, boost histogram or numpy.histogram
```

The file is a mapping from name to object, closed with `with` or `close()`. It
is the real thing — keys, directory, free list, and the streamer information
describing its classes exactly as the ROOT the layouts were harvested from
would — so ROOT, uproot and this library's own reader all read it back by its
own self-description. A name written twice becomes a second cycle of itself,
exactly as in ROOT, and reading back gives the newest.

Records go out as they are made, a few megabytes at a time, so a file far
larger than memory is written in the memory of one basket per column; only the
header at the front, which points at the bookkeeping written last, is held back
and filled in at the close. A `with` block that raises takes back everything it
wrote — the target is cut back to where the file began — on the principle that
no file is better than half a file, and a remote file is opened
persist-on-successful-close, so a process that dies part way leaves the server
nothing. A target that cannot seek, such as a pipe, is the one exception: that
file is kept in memory and written in order at the close.

What can be written is what can be written *correctly*: trees of numbers,
histograms and graphs — read from another file, built from plain numbers, or
made by `hist`, `boost-histogram` or `numpy.histogram` — plus strings and
one-dimensional arrays of signed integers or floats, which become the matching
`TArray`. `Histogram.new` takes every bin edge — or a set of edges per axis,
for two or three — the values shaped the way the axes are (two more along an
axis fills its flow bins), and optionally per-bin errors or variances, axis
labels and an entry count; evenly spaced edges are stored the compact way ROOT
stores an even axis. `TH1D`, `TH1F`, `TH2D` and `TH2F` are written; a
`Histogram.of(...)` turns any histogram Python has into one of these.
`Graph.new` picks its own class: plain points make a `TGraph`, one bar per
point a `TGraphErrors`, and any `(low, high)` pair of runs a
`TGraphAsymmErrors`.

Anything else is refused by name rather than guessed at — a
`TGraphMultiErrors`, an unsigned array ROOT has no class for, a histogram
with fits attached or an axis with labels (empty them first, rather than
have them silently dropped), a name a reader could never ask back for —
because a plausible-looking file that ROOT misreads is worse than an error
message. Files past 2 GB, which need ROOT's wide layout, are refused too:
split the output across files.

`create(..., compression="zstd")` chooses the algorithm — zlib unless said
otherwise, or `lzma`, `lz4`, `zstd`, `None` to store raw — and `level` the
effort; an object that did not get smaller is stored raw anyway, exactly as
ROOT does.

### Trees

`f.tree(name, columns)` declares a tree, and `fill` gives it entries:

```python
with xrdroot.create("out.root") as f:
    tree = f.tree("events", {"energy": float, "hits": ("i", 4), "ok": bool})
    for event in run:
        tree.fill(energy=event.energy, hits=event.hits, ok=event.passed)
```

A column is a Python `bool`, `int` or `float`, an [`array`][array] type code
such as `'f'` for a narrower number, anything NumPy calls a type
(`np.float32`, `"uint8"`, a dtype), or a pair of any of those and how many
values every entry holds — `("i", 4)` is four `int32`s per entry. A Python
`int` gets the widest ROOT has, because a Python int has no width of its own
and a column that quietly stopped fitting halfway down the file would be worse.

`extend` is the fast way in: given a mapping of column name to array, it packs
every column in C, checks the shapes and refuses a float going into an integer
column or an integer too wide for one, and puts the entries into exactly the
baskets filling them one by one would have. Given an iterable of mappings it
takes them as entries instead. Writing a table under a name — `f["events"] =
frame` — declares the tree from the arrays' own types and extends it in one
go.

[array]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html

Entries go out a basket at a time as they gather — `basket_size` bytes of a
column at a time, 32 kB unless said otherwise — so a tree can be far larger
than memory, and reading a range back later costs one read per basket it
touches rather than one read of everything. Each column fills its own baskets
at its own rate, so a wide image column and a one-byte label column do not
force each other's geometry. The tree's own record says where every basket
landed, so it is written when the file closes.

An entry that does not fit its columns is refused whole — nothing is kept for
any column, so the tree is exactly as it was — and it is refused by name:
which column, what it holds, and what arrived instead. Columns are fixed-size
by design; rows of varying length, strings and split C++ objects are refused
rather than approximated, on the same principle as the rest of the writer.

The result is a tree laid out the way ROOT lays one out, down to the record
versions and the `fLeaves` references pointing at the very leaves the branches
hold, so ROOT, uproot and this library's own reader all walk it the same way.

### The datasets everyone teaches with

Converting open data into ROOT — MNIST and its family, CIFAR, the UCI
teaching tables, the Hugging Face Hub mirrors and the rest, more than fourteen
hundred sets of them — is [`xrddatasets`](https://github.com/rob-c/xrddatasets),
which is built on this package and publishes the catalogue those files are
served from.

## Compression

Every algorithm ROOT writes with is read here — and written: zlib, lzma, LZ4,
zstd, and the bare-deflate blocks ROOT wrote before 2005 (read only). LZ4 is
decoded and encoded in Python, checksum and all, when nothing else is there,
and by the C codec of the `lz4` extra when it is — about sixty times faster,
with the checksum then checked on the way in, so a damaged block is refused
rather than decoded. zstd uses Python 3.14's own `compression.zstd` where there
is one and the `zstandard` package otherwise, and is the one case where a file
may need something installed.

## Old files

A tree written by ROOT 4 opens like any other. Those files count entries in
doubles and keep their seek points in 32-bit integers, and one small enough
never to have been flushed holds its baskets inside the branch record rather
than out in the file — all of which is read here, so a decade-old Geant4 run
needs no copying forward first. ROOT 3 and older are refused by name.

## What it refuses, and why by name

A plausible misreading of physics data is worse than a refusal, so anything
this reader does not understand is named rather than guessed at. A column that
cannot be decoded is listed in `tree.unreadable` with the reason, and raises
with the same sentence if it is asked for:

```python
>>> tree.unreadable
{'vtx': 'Vertex, which is a C++ type this reader does not decode: this '
        "file's streamer information does not describe its layout, and a "
        'file written split would have its members as branches of their own'}
```

What is named that way:

- a class whose layout the file's streamer information does not describe, so
  that reading it whole would be a guess;
- a member of an unsplit object of a kind this reader has no reader for, which
  stops the entry it is in, because an unsplit entry is read from first byte to
  last and there is no length in front of a member to step over it by;
- a `multimap`, whose duplicate keys a `dict` would silently drop, and a map
  keyed by a container or nested inside one;
- a `pair` anywhere but directly under its own container, and a container of
  pairs written pair by pair, neither of which any file this reader has met
  writes;
- a graph of layered y errors asked for `yerr`, because summing the layers
  would be an answer this reader made up;
- trees written by ROOT 3 or older.

A class the file describes as having no members at all — `TLimit` is one —
reads as the empty `dict` it honestly is, rather than being refused.

## Errors

`xrdroot.ROOTError` is an `XRootDError`, so it is an `OSError` like
everything else this library raises.

| Exception | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `FormatError` | the bytes are not the ROOT format they claim — a truncated download and an HTML error page both look like this |
| `UnsupportedFeatureError` | a valid file using something this reader does not do, named rather than guessed at |
