"""Writing a ROOT file: keys, objects, and the description that reads them back.

A file written here is the real thing - a header, a directory, one key per
object, a key list, a free list, and the streamer information saying what the
classes look like - laid out the way ROOT 6.08 laid out the donor files the
layouts in :mod:`.winfo` were harvested from. Anything that reads ROOT files
by their own self-description, this library included, walks the result by the
same map it was written from.

What can be written is what can be written *correctly*: histograms, graphs,
strings and arrays of numbers. Anything else is refused by name rather than
guessed at, because a plausible-looking file that ROOT misreads is worse than
an error message. The same goes for the parts of an object this writer cannot
carry - a histogram with fits attached refuses rather than silently dropping
them.

The file is built in memory and written out in one piece when it is closed,
so a ``with`` block that raises leaves nothing behind rather than half a file.
