"""Reading ROOT files, in Python, over the same connection as everything else.

    >>> import xrdroot
    >>> with xrdroot.open_root("root://eos.example.org//store/events.root") as f:  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     tree = f["Events"]
    ...     for batch in tree.iterate(["pt", "eta"], step=10_000):
    ...         train(batch)

ROOT is how experimental physics stores its data, and until now getting at it
from Python meant a C++ toolchain or a wheel with a compiler behind it. This
reads the format itself - keys, directories, trees, baskets and all four of
ROOT's compression algorithms - with nothing but the standard library, and it
reads it a basket at a time, so a tree on the other side of the world costs
the entries you asked for rather than the file.

Numbers, strings, jagged rows, STL containers and the members ROOT splits a
C++ class into are all read, and a split object can be asked for whole. So are
the objects ROOT's own kit writes beside a tree: a histogram comes back as a
:class:`Histogram`, with its bins and its edges where you would look for them,
and a graph as a :class:`Graph` you can walk a point at a time.
What it does not do is every ROOT class ever written: one whose layout the
file does not describe, or one that streams itself in some way of its own, is
refused by name with the class in the message, because a plausible misreading
of physics data is worse than a refusal.

It writes, too: :func:`create` makes a new ROOT file anywhere this library
can put bytes, holding histograms and graphs - read from another file, or
built from plain numbers with :meth:`Histogram.new` and :meth:`Graph.new` -
along with strings and arrays. And both classes draw themselves: ``.plot()``
onto matplotlib axes if matplotlib is there, ``.text()`` into characters
with nothing installed at all.

:mod:`xrdml` turns what comes out into tensors, if PyTorch or TensorFlow
is there; it is a separate package that builds on this one.
