"""Writing a ``TTree``: columns declared once, then entries, then baskets.

A tree written here is laid out the way ROOT laid out the trees in
``tests/data`` - a ``TTree`` record holding one ``TBranch`` per column, each
with its own ``TLeaf`` saying what the values are, and the entries themselves
in ``TBasket`` records elsewhere in the file. That is what makes a tree worth
writing rather than an array per column: reading a range of entries back
costs one read per basket it touches, not one read of everything.

The columns are fixed-size - a number per entry, or a fixed count of numbers
per entry. Rows of varying length, strings and split objects are refused by
name rather than approximated, on the same principle as the rest of the
writer: a file ROOT misreads is worse than an error message.

Entries are buffered a basket at a time, so a tree far larger than memory
costs one basket per column and nothing else. The tree's own record has to
say where every basket landed, so it is written when the file closes.
