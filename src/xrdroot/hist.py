"""Histograms, as objects rather than as the dictionaries they are written as.

A histogram in a ROOT file is a class like any other: a name, a set of drawing
attributes nobody analysing data wants, three axes whether it uses them or not,
and one flat run of numbers holding every bin including the two the axis keeps
for what fell off each end. This turns that into the thing it is - bins, edges
and what is in them - while leaving every member it was written with in reach
under :attr:`Histogram.members`, so nothing is hidden by being tidied away.
