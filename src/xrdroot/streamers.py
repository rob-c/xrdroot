"""What the file says its own classes look like.

Every ROOT file carries a description of the C++ classes it was written from:
for each class, the members in declaration order, each with its type spelled
out. A split branch names only the member, so this is the only place the type
of ``StlVecI16`` can be learnt - and learning it is the difference between a
column that reads and one that is refused.

It is read once, on the first branch that needs it, and not at all by a file
whose branches all say what they hold.
