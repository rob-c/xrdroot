"""From what a branch says it holds to what Python gets back.

A column is one of three shapes and no more: a flat run of numbers, rows of
numbers of differing lengths, or one Python object per entry. Everything
ROOT can write into a branch - a member split out of a C++ class, a
``vector<float>``, a ``map<string,short>`` - lands in one of the three, and
whatever does not land in one of them is refused by name rather than read
approximately. A plausible misreading of physics data is worse than a
refusal, which is why this module says no as precisely as it says yes.
